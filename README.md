This project was my graduation project and it took from me several months to put together, and although it's missing some secondary features like whishlist for example, I am very proud with what I have achieved and what I learned throughout this amazing journey. In the end I implemented the major requirements required in an e-commerce website. Finally, this project was what paved the way for me to build more advanced projects in general, ofcourse all this was not gonna get done - at least not in the time it has - without the help and assistance of AI and online sources.
